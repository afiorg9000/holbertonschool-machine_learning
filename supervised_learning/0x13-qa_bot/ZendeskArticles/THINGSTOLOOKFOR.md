10 things to look for in a certification program for IT employees

1. The program trains your employees on the
technologies that you rely on most.
According to IDC, it’s important for companies to choose
certification programs from “a significant provider of IT
infrastructure.” Or choose a certification program that is an
“industry standard.”1
 Microsoft is a significant provider. In fact,
companies use more than twice as many technologies and
services from Microsoft than from the nearest competitor.2
2. The certifications will amplify your
tech intensity.
Training and certification from Microsoft can help organizations
innovate and stay competitive by building new capabilities
with existing technology. According to a recent study, 91
percent of certified tech professionals believe that the effort
employees put into acquiring new skills strongly contributes
to their success in digital transformation. The same proportion
of tech professionals believes that training and certification
strongly contribute to digital transformation success.

3. The certifications will help close your
skills gap.
The IT skills gap has gone up by 155 percent in the past three years.
Decision makers are struggling to find qualified job candidates.
A big benefit of certified personnel is their ability to close this
skills gap. Over half of all IT decision makers said this is an
advantage. Sixty percent of IT decision makers believe skills gaps
cost their employees between three and eight hours per week.4
4. The certifications will help increase profits.
According to the Association for Talent Development,
companies that offer comprehensive training programs
have a 218 percent higher income per employee than
companies without formalized training. But it doesn’t stop
there; these companies also enjoy a 24 percent higher
profit margin than those that spend less on training.5
5. The certifications will be able to prove ROI.
The value employers and managers place on certification is
undeniable. Ninety-three percent of decision makers around
the world agree that certified employees provide added
value above and beyond the cost of certification.4
 In
addition, 55 percent reported benefits from certification
that were transferable to work situations.

6. You can expect improvements from
your employees.
Compared to their peers, Microsoft-certified developers are
93 percent more productive and nearly 60 percent more
efficient.6
 Certified professionals are also better at meeting
client requirements, increasing productivity, reducing time
to troubleshoot, and completing projects more quickly.7
 IT
professionals who have achieved a relevant, role-based technical
certification perform on average 26 percent better than their
uncertified colleagues with the same responsibilities.8
7. The certifications will have a lasting
impact on my team.
Individuals who believe they can develop their capability through
effort, time, and training have what is called a “growth mindset.”
Tech professionals with a growth mindset put energy into
learning and using new skills, and tech professionals who are
certified are consistently more likely to believe they can learn
difficult skills.9
 Ninety-one percent believe that effort strongly
contributes to their digital transformation success.3
 Additionally,
certification holders foster a sense of commitment to continued
learning and skill development,6
 which supports a continuous
learning culture. They have the confidence and knowledge
companies need to innovate and stay ahead of competition.

8. The certifications focus on the big picture.
The field of cloud computing and related technologies is
dramatically changing the way business is done across all
industry sectors. The cloud is being rapidly adopted and
is expected to become a $300 billion global business by
2021.10 Demand for Azure skills climbed 1,107 percent
between 2014 and 2019.11 Microsoft’s technical role-based
certifications, focused on meeting market demand, are the
best way to build the skills teams need for the cloud era.
9. The certifications will impact your employees
in terms of personal development.
Sixty-seven percent of certified professionals report greater
self-confidence in their abilities because of certification.
Forty-one percent report increased job satisfaction and
35 percent credit certification with giving them greater
excitement and optimism about their career.

10. The certifications will help you retain
the employees.
According to a recent LinkedIn study, companies that rank high on
employee training have 53 percent lower attrition than companies
that are ranked low.13 At the same time, studies show that the costs
related to replacing an employee can be as high as 50-60 percent
of the employee’s annual salary. The total cost of turnover can reach
as much as 90-200 percent of the employee’s annual salary.
