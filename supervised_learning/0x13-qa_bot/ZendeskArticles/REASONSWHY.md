10 reasons to earn a Microsoft Certification
In your career as a technology professional you’ve
witnessed changes coming in waves, touching first one
part of your work, and then another and then everything.
It’s relentless. And in order to stay competitive in the
industry, your employers and clients rely on you to stay
ahead of the tech curve. Maybe they look to you when
they evaluate a move to the cloud, or maybe they bring
you a problem and point to an existing tech stack for
solutions you may or may not be able to create. Whatever
the scenario, you can be sure that the skills you bring
to the table are critical on many levels. Achieving tech
intensity—the ability to use existing tech capabilities
to create new capabilities—comes back to you and
your powerful team of tech pros. And since the success
of any organization depends on whether or not tech
intensity is achieved, training and certifications seem
pretty important all the time, but especially right now.

Who you learn from matters
Many companies offer training and certifications, which can make
choosing the right one confusing. Technology analysts recommend
choosing a certification program from “a significant provider of IT
infrastructure,” or a certification program that is an “industry standard.”1

When it comes to the solutions that businesses use, Microsoft is a
significant provider.2
 Microsoft training and certifications prepare you
for the roles that employers are looking to fill. Let’s take a look at just
ten things you get from Microsoft Certifications.


10 THINGS YOU GET FROM HOLDING MICROSOFT CERTIFICATIONS
1. Recognition from an industry leader
Businesses rely on Microsoft technologies and services to
keep mission-critical applications and processes up and
running. In fact, companies use more than twice as many
solutions from Microsoft than from the nearest competitor.²
There’s a high demand for professionals skilled in Microsoft
technologies and a Microsoft Certification validates your
ability to perform in a modern digital business.
2. A solid foundation
Microsoft has created three types of certifications, each one
to validate different aspects of how you use technology to
solve business problems. Fundamentals certifications build and
validate your understanding of technologies that businesses use.
The combination of conceptual principles and applied learning
lay the foundation for the deeper, role-based learning paths and
certifications offered by Microsoft. There’s a reason Microsoft
Certifications are among the most popular certifications held
by technical professionals globally.3

foundational skills professionals need, then provide an avenue
to deeper technical skills required to perform industry roles and
are kept up-to-date based on market and industry demands.

increases, and 26 percent report job promotions.⁵
And certified IT professionals get promoted more than

. Highly desirable new skills
Research shows that IT professionals who have achieved
a relevant technical certification are more likely to believe
that dedication, hard work, and willingness to use new tools
can lead them to technology competency. And this is what’s
called having a “growth mindset.” Technical professionals with
a growth mindset put energy into learning and using new
skills that can benefit their employers and fill crucial skills
gaps. Ninety-one percent of certified technical professionals

strongly contributes to their success. Technical professionals
